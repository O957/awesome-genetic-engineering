> **Genetic engineering**, also called **genetic modification** or **genetic manipulation**, is the modification and manipulation of an organism's [genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene "Gene") using [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology"). It is a set of [technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering_techniques "Genetic engineering techniques") used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel [organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisms "Organisms"). New [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using [recombinant DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA "Recombinant DNA") methods or by [artificially synthesising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_gene_synthesis "Artificial gene synthesis") the DNA. A construct is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism. The first recombinant DNA molecule was made by [Paul Berg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Berg "Paul Berg") in 1972 by combining DNA from the monkey virus [SV40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40 "SV40") with the [lambda virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_phage "Lambda phage"). As well as inserting [genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene "Gene"), the process can be used to remove, or "[knock out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout "Gene knockout")", genes. The new DNA can either be inserted randomly or [targeted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_targeting "Gene targeting") to a specific part of the [genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome "Genome").
