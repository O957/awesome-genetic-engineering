_A curated list of awesome resources for genetic engineering._

<details markdown=1>

<summary> Definition From Wikipedia </summary>

> **Genetic engineering**, also called **genetic modification** or **genetic manipulation**, is the modification and manipulation of an organism's [genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene "Gene") using [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology"). It is a set of [technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering_techniques "Genetic engineering techniques") used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel [organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisms "Organisms"). New [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using [recombinant DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA "Recombinant DNA") methods or by [artificially synthesising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_gene_synthesis "Artificial gene synthesis") the DNA. A construct is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism. The first recombinant DNA molecule was made by [Paul Berg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Berg "Paul Berg") in 1972 by combining DNA from the monkey virus [SV40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40 "SV40") with the [lambda virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_phage "Lambda phage"). As well as inserting [genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene "Gene"), the process can be used to remove, or "[knock out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout "Gene knockout")", genes. The new DNA can either be inserted randomly or [targeted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_targeting "Gene targeting") to a specific part of the [genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome "Genome").

Image Description: "This is a section of adult rat hippocampus stained with antibody to the neuronal nucleus and perikaryal antibody [NeuN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeuN "en:NeuN") (a.k.a. Fox3) in green and antibody to myelin basic protein (MBP) in red. The MBP reveals neuronal axons while the NeuN antibody reveals neurons but not non neuronal cells. The fluorescent blue DNA stain [DAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAPI "en:DAPI") was used to stain nuclei on neurons and non-neuronal cells.

> This list follows specific scoping guidelines. The **Books** section primarily contains textbooks. **Organizations** is divided into GitHub organizations and non-GitHub organizations. **Researchers** exclusively features researcher GitHub profiles. A **Reading Lists** section was chosen over individual papers, as managing the volume of papers on the topic at hand in a single list in untenable. **Repositories** targets larger work on GitHub and excludes, for example, standalone code for papers. **Datasets** includes only publicly accessible data. **Software** features notable tools, libraries, and frameworks not available on GitHub. **Websites** covers informational sites, news sources, and community hubs. **Educational Resources** includes tutorials, videos, and other learning materials.
